abstract: It is essential that a robot has the ability to deter-mine its position
  and orientation to execute tasks autonomously.Estimating heading is especially challenging
  in indoor environments where magnetic distortions make magnetometer-based heading
  estimation difficult. Ultra-wideband (UWB)transceivers are common in indoor localization
  problems. This letter experimentally demonstrates how to use UWB range and received
  signal strength  (RSS)  measurements to estimaterobot  heading. The RSS of a UWB
  transceiver varies with orientation of the transceiver. As such, a Gaussian process(GP)
  is used to learn a data-driven relationship from  UWBrange and RSS inputs to orientation
  outputs. Combined with agyroscope in an invariant extended Kalman filter, this realizes
  aheading estimation method that uses only UWB and gyroscope measurements.
