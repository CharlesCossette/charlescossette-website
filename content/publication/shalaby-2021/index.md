abstract: The ability to accurately estimate the position of robotic agents relative
  to one another, in possibly GPS-denied environments, is crucial to execute collaborative
  tasks. Inter-agent range measurements are available at a low cost, due to technologies
  such as ultra-wideband radio. However, the task of three-dimensional relative position
  estimation using range measurements in multi-agent systems suffers from unobservabilities.
  This letter presents a sufficient condition for the observability of the relative
  positions, and satisfies the condition using a simple framework with only range
  measurements, an accelerometer, a rate gyro, and a magnetometer. The framework has
  been tested in simulation and in experiments, where 40-50 cm positioning accuracy
  is achieved using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware.
