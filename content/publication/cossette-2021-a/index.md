abstract: A coordinate system is proposed that replaces the usual three-dimensional
  Cartesian x, y, z position coordinates, for use in robotic localization applications.
  Range, azimuth, and elevation measurement models become greatly simplified, and,
  unlike spherical coordinates, the proposed coordinates do not suffer from the same
  kinematic singularities and angle wrap-around. When compared to Cartesian coordinates,
  the proposed coordinate system results in a significantly enhanced ability to represent
  the true distribution of robot positions, ultimately leading to large improvements
  in state estimation consistency. .
