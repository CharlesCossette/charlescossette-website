abstract: Lagrange's equation is a popular method of deriving equations of motion
  due to the ability to choose a variety of generalized coordinates and implement
  constraints. When using a Lagrangian formulation, part of the generalized coordinates
  may describe the attitude. This paper presents a means of deriving the dynamics
  of variable-mass systems using Lagrange's equation while using an arbitrary constrained
  attitude parameterization. The equivalence to well-known forms of the equations
  of motion is shown.
