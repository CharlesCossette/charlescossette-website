abstract: The complex-step derivative approximation is a numerical differentiation
  technique that can achieve analytical accuracy, to machine precision, with a single
  function evaluation. In this letter, the complex-step derivative approximation is
  extended to be compatible with elements of matrix Lie groups. As with the standard
  complex-step derivative, the method is still able to achieve analytical accuracy,
  up to machine precision, with a single function evaluation. Compared to a central-difference
  scheme, the proposed complex-step approach is shown to have superior accuracy. The
  approach is applied to two different pose estimation problems, and is able to recover
  the same results as an analytical method when available.
