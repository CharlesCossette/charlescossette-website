abstract: Thoroughly assessing the performance of launch vehicle control systems often
  requires the use of high-fidelity simulation tools. In particular, launch vehicle
  control systems must take into consideration the effects of propellant slosh as
  well as a flexible structure in order to mitigate oscillations and follow a desired
  trajectory. This paper presents a method for deriving the equations of motion that
  couple the rigid-body, slosh, and flexible dynamics in an accessible and modular
  way. The formulation is generalized to an arbitrary number of propellant tanks and
  flexible modes, thereby being applicable to a variety of launch vehicles. The paper
  concludes with a numerical simulation of an example launch vehicle, showing the
  interaction of the different dynamics.
