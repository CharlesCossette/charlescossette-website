I am a Ph.D. Candidate at McGill University, working with the [DECAR Systems Group](https://www.decar.ca/) under the supervision of Prof. James R. Forbes.

My main research interests are in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, where I specialize in planning, estimation, and control algorithms for multi-robot teams. We are  specifically researching how to best use [ultra-wideband radio](https://www.decawave.com/technology1/) to enable collaboration between robots.
